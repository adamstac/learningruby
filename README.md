# Learning Ruby

Memoirs of an aspiring Rubyist.

## What's this about?

I'm learning Ruby. Everyday I work hard to learn something new about Ruby and use it in new ways. This is my "GitHub as a blog" experiement to create a historical account of my learning.

## Usage?

Usage is simple: `rake`, write, ship.
